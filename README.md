# Cassette Beasts – Inventory Use Item Stack Mod

Adds support for using items directly from stacks, replacing the default single-use inventory behavior — useful for mods that introduce stackable consumables.

If you're adding new items that should behave like stackable consumables, this mod can save you time and reduce boilerplate.

### What's Included:
- A basic framework for handling item stacks in the inventory.
- Helper functions that can be reused or extended.

### Sample Implementation:
- Olive Up!

### Metadata
- Mod ID: `mod_inventory_use_stack`
- Save File Tags: `none` (safe to remove)
- Netplay Tags: `none`
