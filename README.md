# 🎒 Cassette Beasts – Inventory Plus Mod

&nbsp;

## 💡 Bulk Item Use

Enables **bulk use of items**, replacing the default single-action behavior — ideal for mods introducing **stackable consumables**.

If you're developing new items that function as stackable consumables, this mod helps streamline implementation and reduce repetitive code.

&nbsp;

### ✅ What's Included
- Framework for handling bulk use in the inventory  
- Reusable helper functions to support stack item behavior

&nbsp;

### 🛠️ Implementation(s)
- `Olive Up!`  
- `Upgrape`

&nbsp;

### ❓ FAQ

#### Why is `Upgrape` not included in the release `.pck`?
- `Upgrape` *does* function correctly; however, it simply does not **do** anything. This is a <u>design limitation in the base game</u> that may be changed through other mods.
- `MonsterTape`'s grade level-up system differs from `Character`'s. It only supports one level gain per instance, whereas `Character`'s can level up multiple times at once.
